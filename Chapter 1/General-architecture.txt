Various steps are involved which include - 

**Business understanding** - understanding the given use case, good to know more about the domain for which the use cases are built.

**Data acquisition and understanding** - Gathering data from different resources and understanding the data. Cleaning data, performing EDA, etc.

**Modeling** - Building a model using the acquired data. Feature engineering, feature selection. 

Evaluation - Evaluating the performance of the given model on unseen data.

Prediction - Using the trained model to predict values for new observations.

Post prediction if the accuracy is not high, we tune the model either by changing the algo, feature selection or by just gathering more data.

**Deployment** - After building a good model and tuning it as required, we can deploy this model in production to predict values for new observations, either in cloud or in raspberry pi.
monitor the model performance after deployment, if its good go live or re-iterate the above process util the performance is up to mark.

Even after all of this, if the model again performs bad on new/unseen data, we do all the above processes all over again.
