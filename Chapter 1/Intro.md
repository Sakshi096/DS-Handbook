# The Difference Between AI, ML, DS, DL

## AI
At its core, purely mathematics and scientific exercise, now has started to solve human problems through coding, has become computational. A broad domain that makes us believe that we can do anything with computers. Computers can mimic humans too. Uses coding, statistics, mathematics etc.

- **General Purpose AI**
- **Applied AI**

## ML
A sub-branch, where computers learn from data and make predictions based on the learned patterns, without being explicitly programmed to perform these tasks.

- **Supervised**
- **Unsupervised**
- **Reinforcement**

## Data Science
Holds many tools, techniques, and algorithms to handle big data. It is a subset of AI. The goal here too is somewhat similar to ML, to make correct predictions and automate and perform transactions in real time. Relies less on math and coding and more on data and system building to process these data.

## DL
A technique for implementing ML. ML provides us the opportunity to classify data from a given input. DL reads the input and applies it to other data. In ML we can make accurate predictions, but we cannot perform image recognition, etc., which requires more than just dealing with binary outcomes. The neural networks perform micro-calculations with computation on many layers. There is also a concept of weighing data for confidence.

Suppose we want to look at an image and determine whether it belongs to a person's face, eyes, flower, or mask, ML alone is not sufficient to perform this task.
