# We Have Three Major Types

1. **Supervised Learning** - In this model, the algorithm learns on a labeled dataset to generate reasonable predictions for the response to the new data. Examples include forecasting, predicting sales, etc.
   Two major types include:
   - **Regression**
   - **Classification**

2. **Unsupervised Learning** - This learning model is given unlabeled data, and the algorithm tries to make sense of it by extracting features, co-occurrences, and underlying patterns on its own. Examples include clustering, anomaly detection, association, etc.

3. **Reinforcement Learning** - This type depends on the learning agent to determine the output solutions by arriving at different possible ways to achieve the best possible solutions.
